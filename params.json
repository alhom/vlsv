{"name":"VLSV","tagline":"Parallel File Format with a Visualization Plugin","body":"### Welcome to VLSV Repository\r\nVLSV file format was created for writing domain-decomposed unstructured meshes and associated variables efficiently in parallel using the message passing interface (MPI). Here are some features:\r\n* Data written in parallel using collective MPI calls\r\n* Plugin for parallel visualization using VisIt\r\n* Scales to tens of millions of cells per mesh\r\n* Multiple meshes per file\r\n* Supports multi-domain meshes, e.g., one mesh per MPI process\r\n* Support for many common mesh geometries, such as Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinate systems, and generic unstructured meshes\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nLink should appear here shortly!\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nOriginally created for the Vlasiator project by @sandroos.
